# TabNews-clone

This project is a clone of the TabNews platform, developed as a learning exercise to deepen my knowledge of JavaScript, Node.js, and React. The goal is to replicate the core functionalities of TabNews while gaining hands-on experience with full-stack development concepts, including frontend architecture, backend APIs, and data management.
